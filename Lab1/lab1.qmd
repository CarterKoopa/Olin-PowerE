#### Q1: For each waveform, determine the peaks and average.
- **Input Current:** The peak current is 10A. The average value is 1A.
- **Inductor Current:** The peak and average is 10A (as it is constant and connected to a current source).
- **Output Voltage:** The peak and average are each 10A.
- **Voltage Across Inductor:**: The peak is 90V, while the average is 0V.

#### Q2: What waveforms have a small (or no) ripple versus large ripple?
- **No Ripple:** Both inductor current and output voltage are constant values. 
- **Larger Ripple:** The input current has a larger ripple, with a square wave modulating between 0 and 10 amps. The voltage across the current source has the largest ripple ranging from -10 volts to 90 volts.

#### Q3: Which components supply power and which components dissipate power?
- **Supply Power:** The voltage source and current source are supplying power.
- **Dissipate Power:** The resistor dissipates power. As the diode, switch, and all meters are ideal, they do not dissipate any power and act as purely passive components.

Now, the simulation is re-ran after replacing the current source with an inductor with an inductance of 1 mH.

#### Q4: How are the waveforms different? What do they have in common with the prior simulation?

- The inductor current behaves quite differently in this configuration since it is not just connected to a constant source. Rather, the inductor works to resist the change in current, so there is a charge-up period as the inductor builds up a magnetic field before reaching steady state at the same 10A.
- Given there is a constant resistance with the load, the voltage follows this current charge-up curve before reaching steady state at 10V.
- The steady state of each simulation is the same with the inductor current reaching 10A and the output voltage reaching 10V.
- There is slightly more ripple in each waveform than in the first simulation.

#### Q5: After how much time does the circuit reach periodic steady state?
The simulation reaches periodic steady state at around 0.004 seconds (0.4 x 10^-2).

#### Q6: What is the average voltage across the inductor in periodic steady-state?
The average voltage across the inductor is very low - about 0.0005 volts.

#### Q7: What is the voltage conversion ratio for D=10% and D=50%
Based on an input voltage of 100V:
- For D=10%, the voltage conversion ratio is 1/10 and the output voltage is 10V.
- For D=50%, the voltage conversion ratio is 1/2 and the output voltage is 50V.

Now, the inductance is lowered to 10 $\mu$ H.
